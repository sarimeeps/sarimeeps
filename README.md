## About Me! 😊
Hello! My name is Sarah, I am currently a senior at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Charlotte majoring in Computer Science. 

## Projects 👩‍💻
- Lecture-Lounge: A small forum made for students from UNCC's College of Computing and Informatics (CCI) to use to talk to other CCI students.
- Basic weather app: A simple one page application that displays the weather forcast for the current week. Created using React.js and Openweathermap API.

## Work In Progress 👷‍♀️
- Cinemon: A simple website for creating movie/tv show watchlists. Users can find any movie/show and add it to a personal watchlist and share it with other users.

## Goals 🥅
Continue to grow my knowledge in full-stack web and software development!
